                      <p>Hundreds of plant species are present in Antigua and Barbuda, but not yet naturalized. Harris <span className='tb_bottom'>(1965) </span> and other authors  <span className='tb_bottom'>(Lovelace, 1960; Beard, 1949)</span> have collectively identified 204 alien plant species in Antigua. Many were introduced for food or other specific purposes and many have become naturalized.  The current rate of new plant naturalisations in Antigua and Barbuda is at least ten per year, with an estimated 35 species already naturalized.</p>
