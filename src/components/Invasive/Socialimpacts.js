                      <ul>
                        <li> Conflict between neighbours and between sections of the community with differing attitudes to invasive species management.</li>
                        <li>Stress to farm businesses due to the financial consequences of invasive species.</li>
                        <li>Interference with recreational activities, damage to infrastructure or culturally significant sites.</li>
                        <li>Distress caused to farmers when invasive animals injure or kill livestock.</li>
                        <li>Development of human health problems following contact with invasive species e.g.pathogen carried by the Giant African Snail</li>
                        <li>Disturbance from nuisance pest animals such as the presence of rats in a domicile.</li>

                      <p>There is a historical trend in the loss and extinction of biodiversity in Antigua and Barbudaby the clearing of its original vegetation. This includes the cultivation of sugarcane and cotton as well other financially viable and unsustainable developments and land use change.  However, the primary role of development is to improve the quality of human life through utilization of and access to resources. From observation, the trend shows that although most of Antigua and Barbuda’s development has been based on the utilization of our environmental resources, the pathway to development has failed to find an environmentally sustainable course. If invasive alien species are not controlled or eliminated from the national landscape, the quality of human life will be compromised.</p>

                      <p>Threats to national biodiversity have been primarily due “to human activities in pursuit of economic and social development”, <span className='tb_bottom'>(ABNSBAP, 2014, p12). </span>   However, in addition to “human development activities, the country is facing more emerging threats mainly in the form of invasive species and climate change associated impacts” (ABNSBAP, 2014, p12).  This document highlights the biodiversity challenges and threats faced by Antigua and Barbuda (ABNSBAP, p12 & 13). The challenges are: </p>
                    

                      <ul>
                        <ol>1. Fragile terrestrial and marine ecosystems such as mangrove wetlands and coral reefs endangered by development projects, pollution and misuse. </ol>
                        <ol>2. Vulnerability to external economic and natural environmental shocks, such as economic recessions, hurricanes, and climate change. Droughts and hurricanes have severely impacted the bird population, as well as vegetative communities and their dependent fauna. </ol>
                        <ol>3. Lack of human resource capacity in key biodiversity areas and other related fields. </ol>
                        <ol>4. Conflicting land use pressures, especially among housing, tourism and agricultural activities.</ol>
                        <ol>Land degradation; and limited institutional capacity to manage the development process because of the presence of weak and fragmented land use and development control mechanisms. </ol>
                      </ul>
                    
                    </div>

                    <div>
                      <p>The threats include:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <ol>1. The loss of habitat primarily through the subdivision of lands for housing, tourism development, agriculture and the mining and dredging of sand. </ol>
                        <ol>2. Fragmentation of natural communities by road-ways, and other man-made features that form a barrier to the movement and dispersal of species. </ol>
                        <ol>3. The introduction of non-native species, like the Giant African Snail, mongoose, lemon grass and Lion Fish that have a detrimental effect on native wild species by acting as predators, parasites or competitors. </ol>
                        <ol>4. Overgrazing by livestock mainly goats, sheep, cattle and donkeys that pose a serious threat, particularly in upper watershed areas. </ol>
                        <ol>5. Pollution as a result of excessive nutrients or sewage discharge into coastal waters, as well as the unregulated and excessive use of pesticides. </ol>
                        <ol>6. Natural and anthropogenic activities that stress coral reefs (directly and indirectly including through overfishing) </ol>
                      
                      </ul>

                    <div>
                      <p>Invasive alien species seem to be dominant in habitats that have been modified, by destruction, overcrowding, over-exploitation, and destructive fishing methods.  Mangroves that function as nurseries, breeding grounds and habitats for both marine and terrestrial wildlife are being destroyed for coastal development, especially associated with the tourism sector. The sea turtle populations are being impacted by the destruction of critical nesting and foraging habitats through coastal construction, sand mining, pollution and over-fishing. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanisms, though effectively enhanced with the enactment of the new Fisheries Act and its accompanying regulations, is undermined as the necessary capacity to enforce these laws to protect nesting and foraging turtles and their habitats is inadequate. Seagrass beds that provide food for fish and turtles and also function as nurseries for young conch, spiny lobsters, shrimp and a variety of fish are being destroyed. Coral reefs are in very poor condition, stressed by high sedimentation, and activities like over-fishing, destruction by the anchoring of boats, improper placement of fish traps, garbage, breakage by recreational diving, and the release of partly treated sewage from coastal holiday developments directly into the sea. </p>
                      <p>With an increased awareness of the impact of climate change and the importance of the country’s natural resources to its economic survival, renewed efforts have been undertaken to prioritize the protection of such natural resources in the country. This has had significant successes as the government, in partnership with a number of international and regional organizations, has begun the necessary steps to establish and implement a system of protected areas, and develop other policies for natural resource protection and management.</p>
