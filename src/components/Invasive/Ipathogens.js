                      <p>Invasive pathogens can include bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that have negatively impacted the organisms of the native environment usually by causing disease. They can have significant impacts on many native plants and animals, agricultural crops and domesticated animals. In many cases invasive pathogens can rapidly spread through natural habitats, affecting the health and resilience of indigenous species. It is necessary to focus on vectors for effective control.</p>
