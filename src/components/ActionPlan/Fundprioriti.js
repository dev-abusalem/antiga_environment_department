                        The level of service the NIASSC can provide to undertake invasive species management depends on the amount of funding available from the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and external sources. The following priorities related to invasive species control appear for the most part in the Antigua and Barbuda National Strategic Biodiversity ActionPlan (2014 â€“ 2020).  This list of priorities does not include consideration of funding for work required to train operational staff, review operational procedures or incorporate invasive species management(reporting and controlling) in open space,protected areas and sportsgrounds.  These are imperative in achieving the objectives of this plan.

                            <ol>f. Make funding incentives available for invasive species management to friends and landcare groups and landholders in areas identified as supporting high biodiversity and agricultural values.</ol>
                            <ol>g. Seek funding for invasive species management in protected areas. </ol>
                            <ol>i. Seek funding for targeted invasive species management on government land to complement landcare activities and protect high agricultural assets. Support establishment and operation of friends and landcare groups in areas identified as supporting high biodiversity values</ol>
                            <ol>j. Support ongoing ecological management of protected areas. .</ol>
